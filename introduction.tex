Caesar's Gallic War is a two player game based on Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. One player is the Roman player, while the other player is the Barbarian player, and represents the Gallic and German opposition to Rome. The game begins with Caesar's arrival in Gaul in 58 BC and lasts through 51 BC.

During this time both players will attempt to bring Gallic tribal areas under their control either through military or political means. Both players may eventually receive additional units; the Romans can recruit additional legions over the course of the game, while the Barbarian player will eventually receive Vercingetorix and the other Gallic tribes that are allied to the Barbarian cause.

The goal of the game for the Roman player to score as many victory points as possible. This is accomplished by controlling the tribal areas, subjugating tribes, and invasions into certain areas, all while avoiding the loss of Roman legions. The goal of the Barbarian player is to prevent the Roman player from scoring victory points by various means.
