\section{Introduction}
\par
Caesar's Gallic War is a two-player strategy game based on Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. One player takes the role of the Romans, while the other represents the Barbarian opposition, including the Gallic and German tribes. The game begins with Caesar's arrival in Gaul in 58 BC and lasts through 51 BC.
\par
During this period, both players attempt to bring Gallic tribal areas under their control through military or political means. The Romans can recruit additional legions over the course of the game, while the Barbarian player will eventually receive Vercingetorix and other allied Gallic tribes.
\par
The goal of the Roman player is to score as many victory points as possible by conquering and controlling tribal areas, invading certain regions, and minimizing the loss of Roman legions. The Barbarian player's objective is to prevent the Roman player from scoring victory points by various means.
