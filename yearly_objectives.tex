\section{Yearly Objectives}
This is an optional rule designed to steer players towards the actual historical results. The sections below are broken down per year, with a title briefly describing the major events and/or historical figures of that year.

At the end of each turn at the end of the Score Victory Points phase, after scoring points normally, the Roman player may gain or lose additional victory points as the result of certain conditions. Those conditions are dependent on the turn, and are described below. It is possible that more than one condition applies, in which case the Roman player should gain bonus VP first, then apply lost VP afterwards.
