\section{Victory Conditions}
\par
Victory is checked at the end of turn 8 (51 BC). If the Roman player has scored at least X victory points (TBD), then the Roman player is victorious. Otherwise the Barbarian player is victorious.

In addition to the cumulative end of turn VP scored, the following events also affect the Roman player's VP score:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
  \item Each German non-leader unit eliminated: +1 VP
  \item Ariovistus eliminated: +2 VP
  \item Vercingetorix eliminated: +3 VP
  \item Amphibiously invade Britannia with at least 2 legions and fight at least one round of combat: +2 VP*
  \item Invade Germania with at least 2 legions and fight at least one round of combat and/or force at least one German unit to withdraw: +2 VP*
  \item Each Gallic home unit in Britannia eliminated: +1 VP (max 2 VP)*
  \item Each Roman legion unit eliminated: -3 VP
\end{itemize}

Note that the points for invading Britannia and Germania can only be scored once during the game. The number of VP for killing Gallic home units in Britannia is restricted to a maximum of 2 VP.

* Ignore this if playing with the optional Yearly Objectives.
