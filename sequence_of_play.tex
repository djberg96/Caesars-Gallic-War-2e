\section{Sequence of Play}

The game is divided into 8 turns with each turn representing one year. Each game turn is divided into two phases - a Card Phase, where cards are dealt and played, and an End of Turn phase that is conducted after all cards have been played.

The Card Phase is the main phase of the turn. It consists of drawing cards, playing cards, and resolving actions based on the cards played. The Card Phase is where most of the game's actions take place, including activating neutral tribes, moving units, and performing political actions.

The End of Turn phase is where the game state is updated based on the actions taken during the Card Phase. This includes checking the harvest, replacing units, resolving supply and attrition, and scoring victory points.
