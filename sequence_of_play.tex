\section{Sequence of Play}

The game is divided into 8 turns with each turn representing one year. Each game turn is divided into two phases - a Card Phase, where cards are dealt and played, and an End of Turn phase that is conducted after all cards have been played.

The Card Phase is the heart of the game, and is when most of the action will take place.
