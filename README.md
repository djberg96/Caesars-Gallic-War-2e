# Caesars-Gallic-War-2e
Second edition rules for Caesar's Gallic War

These are the rules for the planned 2nd edition of Caesar's Gallic War. Note that until otherwise stated, these rules
should be considered an alpha product and are not necessarily the final rules that will ship with the game, if published.

These are LaTeX files. If you are not familiar with LaTeX and just want everything collated into a single PDF, then
please install LaTeX on your system (there are a few options there, I leave that to you), clone this repo locally, and
then run the following command on a terminal in the cloned directory:

`pdflatex main.tex`

You can then view the output file with any PDF file reader.
